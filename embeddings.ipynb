    "Background Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with nearly 18 million deaths per year, according to the World Health Organization. Rapid detection using predictive models can significantly improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resources\n",

    "In this lab, a logistic regression model is implemented from scratch using NumPy to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical characteristics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and others. This includes data processing, model training, visualization, and a high-level exploration of the implementation using Amazon SageMake."
